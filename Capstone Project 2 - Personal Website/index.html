            <h2>I am an aspiring Computer Science Student at UCSC.</h2>
            <p>As I work my way through the field, I look forward to all the exciting oppurtunities
                that it offers. I hope to get involved in work on Artificial Intelligence and 
                Cybersecurity. With my past interest in computers and software, I have always been 
                passionate to have the ability to explore software firsthand.

        <img src="./assets/icons/user_icon.png" alt="user icon"/>
        <p>Beyond my interest in the Computer Science field, I am always searching for oppurtunities to stretch my creativity. I love spending time 
            admiring art, music, and video production. I have even taken time to explore these fields as a hobby of mine, with a couple of personal 
            past projects. I also love the outdoors and travelling abroad, with my most recent trip being to Ireland, which was a very fun and awe-inspiring 
            experience. As a second-generation immigrant, I also hold close to my family's roots in Eastern Europe and love investing myself into and learning
            more about the culture.
